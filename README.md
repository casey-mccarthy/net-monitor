# Network Monitor

A robust network monitoring application built with Rust for monitoring HTTP endpoints, network hosts, and TCP connections. Available in both GUI and TUI (Terminal User Interface) modes.

## Features

- **Dual Interface Modes**
  - GUI mode: Clean, responsive interface built with egui
  - TUI mode: Terminal-based interface built with ratatui
  - CLI mode selection with default preferences

- **Multiple Connection Types**
  - HTTP/HTTPS endpoint monitoring with status code validation
  - TCP port connectivity checking
  - ICMP ping for network host availability

- **Data Management**
  - SQLite database for persistent storage
  - Import/Export functionality (JSON, CSV)
  - Automatic data migration between versions
  - Configurable monitoring intervals
  - Historical monitoring data with status change tracking

- **Cross-Platform Support**
  - Native binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux
  - Consistent experience across platforms

## Installation

### Download Pre-built Binaries

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/casey-mccarthy/net-monitor/releases):

- **Windows**: `net-monitor-windows-x64.exe`
- **macOS Intel**: `net-monitor-macos-x64`
- **macOS Apple Silicon**: `net-monitor-macos-arm64`
- **Linux**: `net-monitor-linux-x64`

### Build from Source

**Prerequisites:**
- Rust 1.70+ (latest stable recommended)
- Linux only: `libgtk-3-dev` and `libssl-dev`

**Quick start:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/casey-mccarthy/net-monitor.git
cd net-monitor
cargo build --release
./target/release/net-monitor
```

For detailed build commands and development workflows, see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Usage

### Choosing an Interface Mode

The application supports three binaries:

```bash
# Main binary - choose mode interactively or via CLI
net-monitor                    # Default mode or prompt
net-monitor --mode gui         # Launch in GUI mode
net-monitor --mode tui         # Launch in TUI mode
net-monitor --mode gui --save-default  # Set GUI as default

# Dedicated binaries
net-monitor-gui               # GUI only
net-monitor-tui               # TUI only
```

### Basic Usage

**GUI Mode:**
1. Launch the application
2. Click "Add Node" to create a new monitor
3. Enter name, address/URL, and select connection type (HTTP, TCP, or Ping)
4. Click "Check Now" for a single check or "Start Monitoring" for continuous monitoring
5. View real-time status updates in the main window

**TUI Mode:**
1. Launch with `net-monitor --mode tui` or `net-monitor-tui`
2. Use arrow keys and Enter to navigate
3. Press 'a' to add a new node, 's' to start monitoring
4. Press 'q' to quit

### Connection Types

- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Monitor web endpoints, APIs, and services (e.g., `https://example.com`)
- **TCP**: Check TCP port connectivity (e.g., `192.168.1.100:3306` for MySQL)
- **Ping (ICMP)**: Check network host availability (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)

### Import/Export

Import and export your monitoring configuration as JSON files. Available in both GUI (File menu) and TUI modes.

**Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "name": "Google",
    "monitoring_interval": 10,
    "detail": {
      "type": "Http",
      "url": "https://www.google.com",
      "expected_status": 200
    },
    "credential_id": null
  },
  {
    "name": "MySQL Server",
    "monitoring_interval": 30,
    "detail": {
      "type": "Tcp",
      "host": "192.168.1.100",
      "port": 3306,
      "timeout": 5
    },
    "credential_id": null
  },
  {
    "name": "Gateway",
    "monitoring_interval": 5,
    "detail": {
      "type": "Ping",
      "host": "192.168.1.1",
      "count": 3,
      "timeout": 5
    },
    "credential_id": null
  }
]
```

**Usage:**
- **GUI Mode**: Use File menu â†’ Import/Export Nodes
- **TUI Mode**: Press 'i' to import or 'e' to export, then enter file path
- Files must use `.json` extension
- Export creates pretty-printed JSON for easy editing

See [sample_nodes.json](sample_nodes.json) for more examples.

### Data Storage

Application data is stored locally:
- **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\net-monitor\`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/net-monitor/`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/net-monitor/`

## Development
